## 📦 **Project Structure**

* `subtake.go` – main tool source code
* `install.sh` – automated build/install script
* `go.mod` / `go.sum` – Go modules/dependencies
* `config.json` – (optional) example config file
* `targets.txt` – example targets wordlist

---

## 🔥 **Usage**

### **Scan a list of subdomains:**

```bash
./subtake -f targets.txt -o results.txt -t 50 -v
```

* `-f` : input file with subdomains (one per line)
* `-o` : output file (CSV or JSON)
* `-t` : number of threads (default: 50)
* `-v` : verbose output

---

### **Scan a single subdomain:**

```bash
./subtake -d sub.example.com
```

---

### **Export results as JSON:**

```bash
./subtake -f targets.txt -json -o results.json
```

---

### **Additional options:**

* `-ssl` : enable SSL verification (default: false)
* `-deep` : enable deep check (analyze response body/header for every service)
